Simple Kotlin Interpreter Project
Overview
This project involves building an interpreter that reads Kotlin code line by line, analyzes it, and executes it immediately. The interpreter will support a minimal subset of Kotlin, focusing on basic constructs like variables, arithmetic, conditionals, and loops.

Features
Supported Constructs:
Variable Assignment: Define and update variables.
Arithmetic Operations: +, -, *, /, %.
Conditionals: if and else statements.
Loops: while for iterative tasks.
Input/Output: Simple operations using readLine() and println().
Interpreter Design:
Reads Kotlin code line by line.
Parses and executes immediately.
Provides syntax error messages.
Algorithm Demonstrations:
The interpreter's functionality will be demonstrated by executing the following algorithms, with responsibilities divided among the team members:
Mariam Taphlashvili (Group Leader):
Sum of First N Numbers
Factorial of N
GCD of Two Numbers
Mariami Avaliani:
Reverse a Number
Check if a Number is Prime
Ana Gabaidze:
Check if a Number is Palindrome
Find the Largest Digit in a Number
Nikoloz Matchutadze:
Sum of Digits
Multiplication Table
Nth Fibonacci Number
Deliverables

A working interpreter for the specified Kotlin subset.
Test cases demonstrating algorithm execution.
Documentation with usage instructions and examples.
Programming Language: Kotlin
