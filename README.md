                                               Simple Kotlin Interpreter Project
**Overview**

This program is an interpreter that reads code written in Kotlin line by line, analyzes each command, and executes it immediately. It uses a syntax inspired by Kotlin, like val N = 10;, to assign values to variables and execute specific algorithms. These include calculating the sum of the first N numbers, finding the factorial of a number, determining the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, reversing a number, checking if a number is prime, checking if a number is a palindrome, finding the largest digit in a number, calculating the sum of a numberâ€™s digits, printing the multiplication table of a number, and finding the Nth Fibonacci number.

                                                     Features
**Supported Constructs:**

Variable Assignment: Define and update variables.

Arithmetic Operations: +, -, *, /, %.

Conditionals: if and else statements.

Loops: while for iterative tasks.

Input/Output: Simple operations using readLine() and println().

**Interpreter Design:**

Reads Kotlin code line by line.

Parses and executes immediately.

Provides syntax error messages.

**Algorithm Demonstrations:**

The interpreter's functionality will be demonstrated by executing the following algorithms, with responsibilities divided among the team members:

**Mariam Taphlashvili (Group Leader):**

Sum of First N Numbers

Factorial of N

GCD of Two Numbers

**Mariami Avaliani:**

Reverse a Number

Check if a Number is Prime

**Ana Gabaidze:**

Check if a Number is Palindrome

Find the Largest Digit in a Number

**Nikoloz Matchutadze:**

Sum of Digits

Multiplication Table

Nth Fibonacci Number

                                                     Deliverables
