Project: Building a Simple Interpreter

Project Overview

In this capstone project, you will design and implement a simple interpreter
for a programming language. The project will focus on creating and supporting
a minimal subset of the language, with an emphasis on basic constructs like
variables, arithmetic, conditionals, and iterative control flow. The interpreter
will be capable of executing simple algorithms, serving as a proof of its functionality.

Project Objectives
1.	Define a Language Subset:
•	Design a minimal subset of the chosen language.
•	Include essential features such as:
•	Variable assignment.
•	Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %).
•	Conditional statements (if, else).
•	Iterative control flow (while or equivalent loops).
•	Basic input (optional) and output operations.
•	Avoid advanced constructs such as recursion, function calls, arrays, or lists.
2.	Implement the Interpreter:
•	Create a simple interpreter to process and execute code written in the subset.
•	The interpreter must handle parsing and execution.
•	Syntax error detection will be a plus.
•	Focus on simplicity and correctness rather than performance.
3.	Algorithm Execution:
•	Demonstrate the interpreter’s capabilities by implementing and executing a small set of algorithms (see a separate document for details):
1. Sum of First N Numbers
2. Factorial of N
3. GCD of Two Numbers
4. Reverse a Number
5. Check if a Number is Prime
6. Check if a Number is Palindrome
7. Find the Largest Digit in a Number
8. Sum of Digits
9. Multiplication Table
10. Nth Fibonacci Number


Technical Requirements
1.	Language Subset:
•	The subset should provide only fundamental programming constructs.
•	It must avoid recursion, function calls, and complex data structures.
2.	Interpreter Design:
•	Include a parser to analyze and validate the input code.
•	Implement a simple execution engine to handle supported instructions.
•	Provide meaningful error messages for invalid input.
3.	Testing:
•	Verify the interpreter’s functionality by implementing and executing predefined algorithms.
•	Ensure the results are correct and consistent with the subset’s specification.
•	Ensure your implementation correctly interprets mentioned above algorithms.

Deliverables
1.	Language Subset Specification:
•	A concise document defining the subset’s syntax and features.
2.	Interpreter Implementation:
•	A working interpreter capable of parsing and executing the subset.
3.	Test Algorithms:
•	Code examples for simple algorithms executed successfully by the interpreter.
4.	Documentation:
•	A user guide describing how to use the interpreter, including sample programs.

Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:
•	Understand the fundamentals of interpreter design.
•	Learn to simplify programming languages into manageable subsets.
•	Develop skills in iterative control flow, parsing, and syntax processing.
•	Gain experience in building software systems that bridge theory and practice.
•	Gain experience in collaborative development via Guthub.
