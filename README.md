# FOP_PROJECT
Project: Simple Interpreter in Kotlin
Objective:
Design and implement a minimal interpreter for a programming language with essential constructs:

Features:
Variable assignment
Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %)
Conditional statements (if, else)
Iterative control flow (while loops)
Basic I/O operations (optional)
Exclude:
Recursion, function calls, arrays, or lists.
Interpreter Design:

Parse and execute the code written in the subset.
Handle errors with meaningful messages.
Algorithm Execution:

Implement small algorithms to demonstrate functionality:
Sum of First N Numbers
Factorial of N
GCD of Two Numbers
Reverse a Number
Check Prime Number
Palindrome Check
Largest Digit
Sum of Digits
Multiplication Table
Nth Fibonacci Number
Deliverables:
